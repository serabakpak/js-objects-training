/*

  Create a function `daysUntilDate` that accepts a string (with the format `"mm/dd/yyyy"`) and
  returns the number of days (integer) between today and that date. Please use the built in
  Javascript `Date` type in your solution.

  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

  Next, create a function `birthdayReminder` that accepts an array of objects, containing a person's
  date of birth (dob), and returns an array of reminder messages (strings).

  ```javascript
  birthdayReminder([
    {
      name: "Jack",
      dob: "10/31/2013"
    },
    {
      name: "Jill",
      dob: "4/01/1975"
    }
  ]);

  //=> [
  //      "Jack's birthday is in 75 days",
  //      "Jill's birthday is in 305 days"
  //    ]
  ```

  Bonuses
  - Will your function still work tomorrow when the date is different? Is it future proofed?
  - To make your output more relevant, can you sort by days remaining (ascending)?

*/

// YOUR CODE HERE
function daysUntilDate (futureDate) {
  var nowInMs = Date.now();
  var futureInMs = Date.parse(futureDate);
  var diffInMs = futureInMs - nowInMs;
  var diffInDays = diffInMs / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24;
  return Math.ceil(diffInDays);

}

console.log(daysUntilDate('8/25/2016'));

function birthdayReminder (arrayOfObj) {
  
}
